## Demo project for learning NUXT.js

### Overview
After learning Vue I wanted to continue with **NUXT.js** to learn more about **Server Side Rendering.** With my background in **SEO and digital marketing** I know how it is imported for certain apps **(like blogs, shops, news portals) to be able to use SEO.** Also learn a lot about **storing data in cookies and browser local storage** for login and signing up users.

## Practicing
